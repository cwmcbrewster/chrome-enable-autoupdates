# Chrome Enable AutoUpdates
This script enables system wide automatic updates for Google Chrome.


## Background
My involvement in this script spawned from [this Jamf Nation thread](https://www.jamf.com/jamf-nation/discussions/23323/how-to-update-chrome-automatically). Somehow I became responsible, so I decided to add it here for the community.

There is a [python version of this script](https://github.com/hjuutilainen/adminscripts/blob/master/chrome-enable-autoupdates.py) (which I also contributed a tiny piece to) that I would recommend if you'd rather use it.
